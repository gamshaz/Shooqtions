# KCP STIR Options Structure Generator

## What this is

A desktop tool for the KCP rates sales desk. Desk member types a trade scenario in natural language; the tool emits a grouped list of listed STIR option structures in PricingMonkey (PM) trade-description grammar. User clicks Copy, pastes into PM, and PM does all pricing, Greeks, and strike validation.

## Who uses it

Four rates desk traders. None are software engineers (the project owner is the most technical). Day-to-day use must not require opening a terminal, editing config, or touching code.

## Architecture (locked — do not re-litigate without explicit ask)

    NL → structured params (product, expiry, anchor_price, directional_view,
                            families, tightness, cost_preference, flags)

**Rejected and not to be re-proposed:**

- Browser automation of any flavour (Selenium, Playwright, CoWork, computer-use)
- Direct Anthropic SDK calls (per-call API billing)
- Local LLM (no GPU on work PCs)
- PM-cell input / PM readback
- Any NL parsing inside the enumerator or desk conventions inside the prompt

## Responsibility split

**LLM parser (`claude -p`):** mushy natural language → clean params. Extraction only. No arithmetic, no desk conventions, no structure enumeration, no wing-direction reasoning.

**Python enumerator:** params → PM trade-description strings. All desk rules live here as explicit code with comments and unit tests. Anything that requires a desk convention — wing direction for "in favour" vs "against", which families count as "cheap", tightness → width mappings, how many variants per family — is Python, not prompt.

## Hard constraints

1. **No per-call API charges at runtime.** `claude -p` subprocess only; no `from anthropic import Anthropic`.
2. **No browser automation.** Clipboard paste via `pyperclip`; user Ctrl+V themselves.
3. **No local options math.** No Black-76, no vol surface, no Greeks. PM prices everything.
4. **Windows + Chrome + Claude Code + PM-in-browser** is the entire runtime target.
5. **Non-engineer users.** Install and use without CLI. Tkinter window double-click launch.

## Desk convention principle

Desk conventions can invert general options intuition. Example burned us already: "broken in favour" refers to **cost economics, not payoff geometry** — for a bullish view, the lower wing is wider than the upper wing (body closer to the upper strike), which is the *opposite* of what payoff-geometry reasoning would pick.

**Rule:** when encoding a rule that touches desk convention, ask the user. Do not reason from first principles. Encode the answer as Python with a comment block and unit tests locking concrete strike tuples. The user's tuples are the source of truth; the rule statement is the documentation.

## Products in v1 scope

- **SOFR** (`SFR`) whites + 1y mid-curve (`0Q`)
- **Euribor** (`ER`) whites + mid-curve (`0R`)
- **SONIA** (`SFI`) whites + mid-curve (`0N`)

Whites = front 4 quarterlies (H/M/U/Z).

**Strike grids:** SOFR 6.25bp, Euribor 6.25bp, SONIA 5bp.

**Out of v1 scope:** USTs, EGBs, Gilts, OTC.

## Structure families in v1

Outrights, vertical spreads, flies (symmetric + broken in-favour + broken against), condors (symmetric + broken), ratio spreads (1×2, 1×3), ratio flies (1×3×2, 1×2.5×1, etc.), risk reversals, straddles, strangles, calendars/diagonals.

## Working conventions

- **Plan fully first, one file at a time.** Do not write file N+1 before the user confirms file N.
- **Golden tests gate prompt/skill changes.** 10–15 hand-labelled scenarios with expected JSON output.
- **Ask for desk conventions.** Never infer. Concrete tuples from the user become unit tests.
- **No sycophancy.** If the user is wrong or a suggestion would regress an earlier decision, say so.
- **Small commits, working code at each step.**
- **Portable context in the repo.** All load-bearing project context lives in `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/` so a session can be resumed from any machine with a clone.

## Key files

- `CLAUDE.md` (this file) — root-level project context
- `docs/pm_grammar.md` — PricingMonkey trade-description grammar + v1 canonical forms
- `docs/spec.md` — frozen v1 spec (inputs, outputs, enumerator rules)
- `docs/plan.md` — implementation plan, file-by-file
- `PM_Trade_Input.docx` — original PM grammar doc (source for `pm_grammar.md`)

## Future scope (not v1 — don't architect it out)

Weekly flow analysis add-on: read flagged flows from PM export, append to persistent log, generate weekly rundown via `claude -p`. Built after v1 is live.
